<h1> What is Turma da Inbonha?</h1>
<br/>
<p>Turma da Inbonha was created by some kid, by misspelling the name of the kid's comic Turma da Monica's characters. <br/>
The kid changed the order of the syllables in hilarios way</p>
<br/>
<h1>How it works?</h1>
<p>It shuffles the syllables of the names, and lay them shuffled beside the character pictures.<br/>
Notice that the algorithm randomizes if 'NI', from MoNIca, will become 'NI', or 'IN' (upside down, as the kid did).</p>
